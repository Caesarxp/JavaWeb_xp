<!--
     This is a blank Struts configuration file with an example
     welcome action/page and other commented sample elements.

     Tiles and the Struts Validator are configured using the factory defaults
     and are ready-to-use.

     NOTE: If you have a generator tool to create the corresponding Java classes
     for you, you could include the details in the "form-bean" declarations.
     Otherwise, you would only define the "form-bean" element itself, with the
     corresponding "name" and "type" attributes, as shown here.
-->


<struts-config>
<form-beans>
	<form-bean name="myfrom" type="com.xp.from.MyFrom"></form-bean>
</form-beans>

<action-mappings>
	<action path="/login.do"
		type="com.xp.action.MyAction"
		name="myfrom"
		scope="request"
		validate="true"
	>
	
	
	<forward name="sucess" path="/WEB-INF/pages/sucess.jsp" />
	<forward name="erro"   path="/WEB-INF/pages/erro.jsp" />
	
	</action>
	
	
</action-mappings>
